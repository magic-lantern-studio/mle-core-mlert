<h1>Magic Lantern SDK - Runtime Engine Library</h1>
<p>The Magic Lantern Software Development Kit provides a runtime engine to facilitate 
  title execution. In fact, if a title is not using the Magice Lantern Runtime 
  Engine, then it is not a Magic Lantern title. The Runtime Engine controls the 
  lifecycle of the title.</p>
<p>The execution model that contols the sequencing of Magic Lantern titles is 
  a cyclic process repeated once per frame. Each actor, role, set, and stage receives 
  control of the processor, in that order. By default, on each frame, all of the 
  actors execute before any of the roles; all of the roles execute before any 
  of the sets, etc. This scheduling order is not strict, however, since an actor 
  may explicitly pass control to its role and that role may explicitly pass control 
  to its set. Programmers can also reorder or augment the scheduling.</p>
<p> The idea behind tha actors-then-roles-then-sets-then-stage ordering is that 
  first the interactivity is computed (actors), then the presentation is computed 
  (roles), then the various resource controllers gain control (sets), then the 
  entire frame presentation is created (stage).</p>
<p>The Runtime Engine Library povides support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interface and base classes for Actor, Role, Media Reference, Set, Stage 
    and Prop title components,</li>
  <li>Event dispatching,</li>
  <li>Scheduling of title execution,</li>
  <li>Reading and processing the Digital Playprint.</li>
</ul>
