/**
 * Base class for runtime actor groups.  
 * <p>
 * The group is the minimal unit of actor loading at runtime.
 * A group may contain one or more actors and every actor must be loaded as part of a group
 * defined in a MleDwpGroup item in the Digital Workprint.
 * A group may  be loaded directly at runtime by calling the MleDppLoader.mleLoadGroup() method.
 * </p><p>
 * At runtime the MleGroup object holds an array of refernces to 
 * all the actors it has loaded.  When the group is deleted, it
 * deletes all actors it refers to.  Similarly, a MleGroup loaded as
 * part of an MleScene is deleted when the containing scene is deleted.
 * </p>
