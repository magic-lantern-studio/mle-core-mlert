/**
 * <code>MleRole</code> is a class that is used to
 * specify the platform-specific interface of an actor.
 * <p>
 * MleRole implements the platform-specific code
 * for an actor. Each instance of MleActor can have
 * zero or one corresponding role instance.
 * At runtime, the only space overhead for MleRole
 * is a reference to the role's actor instance.
 * </p><p>
 * getActor() returns the role instance's corresponding
 * actor instance. init() can be used to initialize the
 * role after it has been attached to its actor
 * and to the set/role hierarchy.
 * </p><p>
 * MleRole instances are created by MleDppLoader.loadGroup() and
 * Mle.loadScene() when actors are loaded from
 * either the workprint or playprint. MleDppLoader.loadGroup()
 * (which is called by MleDppLoader.loadScene()) goes through
 * the following sequence to initialize the role/actor
 * pair:
 * </p><p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li> When an actor is found inside a group that
 *        is being loaded, the actor is created 
 *        (i.e., memory is allocated and its constructor is called).
 *   </li>
 *   <li> The values of the actor's properties
 *        in the workprint (or playprint) are inserted into the
 *        appropiate actor member variable locations in memory.
 *   </li>
 *   <li> If the workprint (or playprint) has a
 *        role class binding for the actor, then an
 *        instance of that role class is created
 *        (the role's constructor is called).
 *   </li>
 *   <li> The role instance is bound to its actor.
 *   </li>
 *   <li> The role is attached either to another
 *        role or to the current set, depending
 *        on whether the role class supports
 *        role-to-role attachment. addChild() is
 *        used to add a role to another role
 *        whenever the roles support attachment.
 *   </li>
 *   <li> The role's actor init() member function
 *        is called. This allows the actor to do
 *        final initialization since all of its data
 *        has been loaded and its role has been
 *        attached. The role actor might at this
 *        point call the role's init() function.
 *   </li>
 * </p><p>
 * MleRole's instance variable <i>m_set</i> points to the
 * role instance's set (i.e., the set to which
 * it is directly or indirectly attached).
 * </p>
