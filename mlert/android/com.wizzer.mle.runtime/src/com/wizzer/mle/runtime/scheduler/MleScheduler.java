/**
 * The <code>MleScheduler</code> class is used to schedule phases of execution
 * which might be required by a runtime engine. For example, a 3D game engine
 * might require four phases of execution:
 * <ol>
 * <li> a behavioral pass on a scene graph to update an actor's behavior
 * <li> a pre-render pass on a scene graph to calculate transformations
 * <li> a render pass on a scene graph to render a scene to an offscreen buffer
 * <li> a post-render pass to blit the offscreen buffer to a screen
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Each phase of the scheduler must be registered by calling
 * <code>addPhase</code> with an instance of the <code>MlePhase</code> class.
 * The <code>MlePhase</code> class is a collection of tasks which must be
 * executed during that phase.
 * The tasks are actually <code>java.lang.Thread</code> objects encapsulated by
 * the <code>MleTask</code> class.
 * </p>
