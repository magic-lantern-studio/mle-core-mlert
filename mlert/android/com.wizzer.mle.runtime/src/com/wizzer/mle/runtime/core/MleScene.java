/**
 * Base class for Magic Lantern Runtime scenes.
 * <p>
 * The scene is the maximal  unit of actor loading at run time. 
 * A scene may contain one or more groups or group references.
 * A scene may be loaded directly at runtime by calling the
 * <code>MleDppLoader.mleLoadScene()</code> method.
 * </p><p>
 * Two distinguished scenes may be active at once in a title.  The 
 * <i>current</i> scene is set by scene loading, unloading, or 
 * changing methods.  The <i>global</i> scene is under user control
 * and is intended to hold a scene that will govern transitions between
 * two current scenes, for instance during a level change in a game.
 * </p><p>
 * At run time the MleScene object holds an array of references to 
 * all the groups it has loaded.  When the scene is deleted, it
 * deletes all groups it refers to.
 * </p>
